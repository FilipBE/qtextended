messaging in Qt Extended. It provides the facility to receive emails from 
multiple mail servers as well as SMS and MMS messages from other mobile phone devices. 
It also allows email, MMS and SMS messages to be sent to 
multiple people with or without attachments. <nop>SMS messages are 
sent and received via the GSM cellular network.  <nop>MMS and email 
are sent and received via TCP/IP based networks, usually GPRS on a 
mobile phone. MMS messages are sent and received over the 
standard HTTP protocol. Most messages conforming to RFC2822 and 
RFC2045-RFC2049 are supported as are POP and IMAP authentication. 
Application requirements include available messaging storage on the 
device of approximately 1.5 times the server mailbox size and the 
services of an image viewer are required for viewing image 
attachments.

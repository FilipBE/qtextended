<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This page describes changes to Qtopia Sync Agent 4.3&#x2e;2&#x2e;</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed numerous crash bugs.</li>
<li>Correct the progress reporting on the device. It's still a bogus indicator but it now goes from 1 to n instead of stopping at n-1.</li>
<li>The connection timeout code was restored but it defaults to off. The Greenphone requires this code to be in operation due to it's inability to detect a disconnect event. The device timeout is now 3x the value the desktop uses.</li>
<li>Objects of an unexpected type returned from Outlook are ignored.</li>
<li>A bug causing items created in Outlook to be duplicated at every sync has been fixed.</li>
<li>Tasks modified in the server are now changed on the device.</li>
<li>The <a href="over-sync-manager-1.html">Sync Manager</a> page documents the merge algorithm used by Qtopia Sync Agent.</li>
<li>The <a href="qdsync-commands.html">qdsync Protocol</a> has been ammended to close a security hole related to <tt>CALLB</tt> messages.</li>
<li>You can now force a slow sync (look in the Tools menu). Note that a slow sync will create many duplicate records due to how the merge algorithm works and because Qtopia and Outlook generate different XML for the same record.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem where a slow sync (forced or otherwise) causes identifier mappings to be lost. Identifier mappings are now stored with a dataset. Qtopia Sync Agent associates a dataset with the existing mappings as it maps them so the upgrade process is gradual.</li>
<li>Fixed the XML writing code that the Outlook plugin uses to avoid text encoding bugs.</li>
<li>Fixed a Synchronization bug causing Outlook appointments with no alarm to be only partially transferred to Qtopia.</li>
<li>Correctly parse long items so that notes are transferred in full.</li>
<li>The clock does not need to be set the same on the client and desktop.</li>
<li>All day events can now be synchronized correctly between Qtopia and Outlook. This also resolves the problem of events starting and ending at midnight.</li>
<li>Outlook items that are not known to Qtopia Sync Agent but have a last modified timestamp that is before the sync timestamp are now transferred.</li>
<li>Outlook events have their recurrence cleared before being updating to prevent a crash.</li>
<li>Birthdays and anniversaries are no longer duplicated in the calendar.</li>
</ul>
<a name="known-issues"></a>
<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Serial connections are unreliable.</li>
<li>Synchronization will not send any Calendar events to Qtopia Sync Agent due to a logic bug.</li>
<li>Contacts created from Exchange addresses will have incorrect emails transfered to Qtopia.</li>
<li>Appointments with removed occurrences in Outlook will results in blank events being created in Qtopia.</li>
<li>Appointments with exceptions in Outlook will result in the Outlook security dialog being displayed.</li>
</ul>

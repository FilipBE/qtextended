<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Qtopia 4.2&#x2e;2 release is a maintenance release of Qtopia that is based on Qt 4.2 technology. This release provides a number of bug fixes and performance improvements, both general and Greenphone-specific.</p>
<a name="enhancements"></a>
<h2>Enhancements</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><b>Bluetooth</b> Bluetooth support is provided in this release only as a technology preview. When building Qtopia, Bluetooth is disabled by default, but may be enabled by specifying the -bluetooth configure switch.</li>
<li><b>Clock</b> The Clock application has been made consistent with other Qtopia applications by using a tabbed window to present the three different screens rather than using entries in the context menu to switch between the three screens.</li>
<li><b>Greenphone</b> The Greenphone now displays information about its progress during startup and shutdown.</li>
<li><b>Signal Strength Indication</b> The signal strength indicator can now be used to indicate the signal strength of any communications medium, not just GSM modem signal strength. This is done by writing appropriate values to the Qtopia Valuespace. Note that this change requires minor modifications to all custom themes that display signal strength as described in <a href="porting.html">Porting Between Qtopia/Qt Extended Versions</a>.</li>
</ol>

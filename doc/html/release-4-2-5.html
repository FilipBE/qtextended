<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Qtopia 4.2&#x2e;5 release is a maintenance release of Qtopia that is based on Qt 4.2 technology. This release provides a number of bug fixes and documentation updates.</p>
<a name="enhancements"></a>
<h2>Enhancements</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><b>Bluetooth</b> Bluetooth support is provided in this release only as a technology preview. When building Qtopia, Bluetooth is disabled by default, but may be enabled by specifying the -bluetooth configure switch.</li>
<li><b>Documentation</b><p>Many of the non-class documentation pages have been revised and/or expanded for this release, and a number of new documentation pages have been added. (The class documentation has already been revised in the earlier 4.2&#x2e;3 release.)</p>
</li>

<a name="known-issues"></a>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><b>Greenphone</b>:<ul>
<li>BUG 171152: Due to a bug in the modem firmware, outgoing calls may not be canceled correctly if the user presses the hangup key while the call is in the &quot;dialing&quot; state. Qtopia attempts to work around this by attempting to cancel the call after it transitions from &quot;dialing' to &quot;alerting&quot;. This strategy fails in cases where the call transitions directly from &quot;dialing&quot; to &quot;connected&quot;.</li>
<li>BUG 176936: Due to incorrect factory calibration, some Greenphone handsets do not perform noise cancellation correctly. This may result in significant levels of echo being heard when using the handset indoors. This level of echo can be reduced by adjusting the microphone and speaker volumes via the <b>Call Options</b> application's <b>Call Volume</b> feature.</li>
<li>BUG 179229: The Greenphone modem does not report whether an incoming call has been diverted from another number. Thus Qtopia is unable to indicate Call Diversion to the user, and the Greenphone therefore fails to achieve GCF Standard Compliance for this function.</li>
<li>BUG 180951: On some Greenphones, the Bluetooth subsystem regularly gets into a state where no further Bluetooth operations will succeed until the device is reset. This is believed to be a fault in the hardware and/or kernel, rather than a problem with the Qtopia software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Media Player</b>:<ul>
<li>BUG 142554: After a call ends, Media Player incorrectly resumes playback of media file if the file was paused when the call was received.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Messages</b>:<ul>
<li>BUG 142744: MMS audio doesn't play to completion if the audio track is longer than the slideshow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Neo 1973 (ficgta01 device profile)</b><ul>
<li>BUG 197301: SIM Applications are not supported on the Neo 1973 in this release.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Safe Execution Framework</b><ul>
<li>BUG 195751: The LIDS franmework is not able to protect network sockets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Server Widgets</b>:<ul>
<li>BUG 148987: The Task Manager list only works correctly with the Standard Qtopia server widgets.</li>
</ul>

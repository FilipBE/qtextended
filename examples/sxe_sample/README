This sample project shows how to create a QtExtended SXE program
and package it for delivery via an SXE Server.

The steps are:
1) Create QtExtended source code files as normal, eg main.cpp, mywidget.cpp
2) Create .pro file as normal, eg mywidget.pro
3) In the .pro file, do "pkg.domain=untrusted" 
4) Do "qbuild && qbuild packages"
5) Use the mkPackages script to install the packages in your feed

The script "genpackages.pl" included in this example uses the one set of
source files to create a set of sample packages for testing the packagemanager,
which can be installed in a web server for testing purposes.

Assuming Qtopia has been shadow built, to use the script
do something like:

$ mkdir $HOME/build/malpkg && cd $HOME/build

# linking the files in will avoid messing up the source tree
# ($QTOPIA_DEPOT_PATH refers to the qtopia source tree)
$ lndir $QTOPIA_DEPOT_PATH/examples/sxe_sample malpkg

$ cd malpkg

$ export QPEDIR=$HOME/path/to/qtopia/build/tree
$ export PATH=$QPEDIR/bin:$PATH
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QPEDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# set up a bunch of similarly named packages and build them
# will make all the packages listed in malpkg.pro under pkg.multi
./genpackages.pl

#install them in this machines http server root
sudo mkdir -p /srv/www/htdocs/feed
$QTOPIA_DEPOT_PATH/bin/mkPackages /srv/www/htdocs/feed

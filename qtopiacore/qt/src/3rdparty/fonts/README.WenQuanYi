 I. Introduction

The bitmap font in this package includes complete CJK Unified 
Ideographics (U4E00~U9FA5) glyphs at four different sizes 
(9pt-12X12 pixel, 10pt-13X13 pixel, 11pt-15X15 pixel,
and 12pt-16X16pt) and two weights (medium and bold). 
This font is designed for displaying Chinese (CJK) on 
most GNU Linux/Unix based computer systems. Manually 
optimized bitmap Chinese glyphs can achieve superb visual
effect on computer screens. In comparison, anti-aliasing
and auto-hinting of CJK true-type font could only produce
blurry, spiky or distorted glyphs and make it very 
difficult to read. 

This font is built upon the previous works by firefly
(firefly@firefly.idv.tw)[2] and The Institute of Software, 
Academia Sinica[3]. We would like to give our sincere thanks 
to their ground-breaking contributions for the Chinese 
open-source community. 

The sheer majority of the work to build this release 
was done by Qianqian Fang (fangq@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu).
At the same time other contributors from the WenQuanYi 
project are focusing on the bitmap development for CJK 
Extension A and vector font development for CJK Basic.

We release this font to the public as an open-source software 
in terms of GPL. You are free to copy, distribute, and/or 
modify this font within the scope of this license.

We hope you find this font useful. Please send your feed back,
bug-report to our forum at

  http://wenq.org/forum/

We sincerely invite you to join us by contributing to our 
project. Donation or collaboration options are also provided.

 III. About The WenQuanYi Project

The WenQuanYi Project was created by Qianqian Fang[8] in 
Oct 2004. The goal of this project is to enrich open-source 
Chinese software and resources and construct a fundamental
framework for Eastern Asia (Chinese, Japanese and Korean etc) 
open source communities. A mile-stone of the framework is 
to create high quality bitmap character glyphs and outline 
fonts for all 70,000+ Chinese characters currently encoded 
by the Unicode Consortium.

There are two ongoing sub-projects which are the 
Bitmap Chinese project and Vector Chinese project. 

The WenQuanYi Project use Wiki[1] as the primary 
development tool for glyph creation, documentation
and organization. The project is greatly benefited from the
large-scale/distributed/parallel cooperative  
mechanism provided by Wiki engine. About half of the 
font editing (more than 16,000) was done online with
the JavaScript tools in Wiki page.

There project consists of a "Steering Committee" by the
core members, and a "Team B" for bitmap Chinese font 
development, a "Team V" for outline font development.
Need to mention, a large number of anonymous contributors 
also participate our development through our Wiki site
and their contributions are non-negligible.

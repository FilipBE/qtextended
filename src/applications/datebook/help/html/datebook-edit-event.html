   <h2>Add / Edit Event</h2>
<!--#endif -->
<p><b>To add an event to your calendar or edit an existing event:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Adding an event</b>: in day view or month view press <img src=":icon/options"><b>Options</b>, then select <b>New</b> from the menu.</li>
<li><b>Editing an event</b>: view the event and press <img src="icon/options"><b>Options</b>, then select <b>Edit event</b> from the menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>The details of an event are split over three tabs.</p>
<p>The <b>Event</b> tab has fields for most of the details of the event, including: 
<ul>
<li><b>Desc.</b> description shown for the event.</li>
<li><b>Loc.</b> where the event is.</li>
<li><b>All day event</b> select if the event covers the whole day.</li>
<li><b>Start, End</b> date/time of start and end of event.  If the <b>All day event</b> checkbox is selected, only the start/end date of the event will be shown.  If you adjust the start time of an event, the end time will also be adjusted to keep the same event duration.  To make an event longer or shorter, first set the start time of the event, then adjust the end time.</li>
<li><b>T.Z.</b> <a href="worldtime-timezones.html">time zone</a> where event takes place.</li>
<li><b>Reminder</b> choose whether to have a reminder that the event will start soon.  You can choose either a silent reminder or an audible reminder, and when you want the reminder to occur. For an all day event, you can choose the time of day that the reminder should occur.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <b>Recurrence</b> tab allows you to configure how the event repeats, including: 
<ul>
<li><b>Repeat</b> choose a type of repetition (daily, weekly etc).  Depending on the type of repetition, more options may be available to customize the repetition.</li>
<li><b>Frequency</b> choose how often the repetition will occur.  For example, a frequency of 2 and a repetition type of daily means that the event will repeat every 2 days.</li>
<li><b>Repeat until</b> check this option and select a date if the repetitions should stop on or before a specific date.</li>
<li><b>On these days</b> when choosing a weekly repeat, an option to choose additional days of the week to repeat on will appear.  The original event start day of the week is always selected.  This allows you to create events that will repeat on every weekday, or on any particular days you specify.</li>
<li><b>Repeat on</b> when choosing a monthly repeat, you can specify how the day of the month is interpreted. This allows you to specify events that recur on certain days of certain weeks (for example, the first Tuesday), or a fixed day of the month (for example, the 17th of each month).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Notes</b> this tab contains extra information about the event, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Category</b> used to group similar events. </li>
<li><b>Notes</b> enter additional information for an event.</li>
</ul>

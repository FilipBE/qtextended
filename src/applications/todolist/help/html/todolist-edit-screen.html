<h3>Task Editing</h3>
<!--#endif-->
<p>To create a new task, or edit an existing task, several tabs with the details of the task are presented:</p>
<b>Task:</b> This tab has essential task information on it.</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Description:</b> enter a brief description (shown as the title in the list of tasks).</li>
<li><b>Priority:</b> to help you prioritize your tasks:
<ul><li>1 = Very High<li>2 = High<li>3 = Normal<li>4 = Low<li>5 = Very Low</ul></li>
<li><b>Due:</b> check this option and select a date if the task has a due date; tasks of equal priority will be sorted by due date.</li>
<li><b>Reminder:</b> if you have set a due date, you can choose to have a reminder that the task is due soon.  You can choose either a silent reminder or an audible reminder, and when you want the reminder to occur.</li>
</ul>
<b>Progress:</b> This tab allows you to edit the progress information for a task.
<ul>
<li><b>Status:</b> to indicate the current status of the task:
 <ul><li>Not Started<li>In Progress<li>Completed<li>Waiting<li>Deferred</ul>
Completed tasks have a check mark in the list; all tasks can have a percentage complete (except Not Started, which is zero percent complete by definition).</li>
<li><b>Started Date:</b> the date you started the task.  This can be set manually, or will be automatically set if you change the task status to anything except Not Started.</li>
<li><b>Completed Date:</b> entered automatically when a task is marked complete.</li>
</ul>
<b>Recurrence:</b> This tab allows you to set whether a task repeats. This allows you to store tasks like "take out the rubbish", or "create end of month report".
<ul>
<li><b>Repeat:</b> choose a type of repetition (daily, weekly etc).  Depending on the type of repetition, more options may be available to customize the repetition.</li>
<li><b>Frequency:</b> choose how often the repetition will occur.  For example, a frequency of 2 and a repetition type of daily means that the task will be due every 2 days.</li>
<li><b>Repeat until:</b> check this option and select a date if the repetitions should stop on or before a specific date.</li>
<li><b>On these days:</b> when choosing a weekly repeat, an option to choose additional days of the week to repeat on will appear.  The original due date's day of the week is always selected.  This allows you to create tasks that will repeat on every weekday, or on any particular days you specify.</li>
<li><b>Repeat on:</b> when choosing a monthly repeat, you can specify how the day of the month is interpreted. This allows you to specify tasks that recur on certain days of certain weeks (for example, the first Tuesday), or a fixed day of the month (for example, the 17th of each month).</li>
</ul>
<b>Notes:</b> this tab contains extra information about the task.
<ul>
<li><b>Category:</b> used to group like tasks. </li>
<li><b>Notes:</b> enter more detailed information for a task.</li>
</ul>

  \brief The QtopiaServerApplication class provides additional QtopiaApplication
         functionality.

  \section1 Qt Extended Server Tasks

  The QtopiaServerApplication class acts as a QtopiaApplication instance in
  Qt Extended Server.  QtopiaServerApplication is primarily responsible for bringing
  up and shutting down the Qt Extended server and acts as the "core" controller in
  the system. This class is part of the Qt Extended server and cannot be used by other Qt Extended applications.

  The Qt Extended server is structured as a collection of largely independent
  \i tasks that are responsible for performing a small, well defined portion
  of work or functionality which often form the "backend" to other system
  capabilities.  For example, the network management APIs ultimately
  communicate with the QtopiaNetworkServer task, other tasks may operate more
  independently.  Tasks can be thought of as the building blocks that form the Qt Extended server, when arranged appropriately.

  Tasks are QObjects and may work together by exporting C++ interfaces.
  Other tasks or modules within the server may request tasks that support a
  particular interface.  For example, when the system is shutting down, all the
  tasks that provide the SystemShutdownHandler interface are invoked to perform
  all the necessary cleanup.

  The order in which the task objects are instantiated is configurable.  Both
  the \i configurator and the task developer has a degree of control over the
  instantiation order.  The \i configurator controls the start up order through
  the \c {$QPEDIR/etc/Tasks.cfg} file which has the following simple syntax:

  \code
  # Sample comment for TaskGroup1.  Comments may appear anywhere, as long as
  # the first character in the line is a '#'
  [TaskGroup1]
  TaskName1
  +TaskGroup2
  # Likewise, blank lines, as well as leading and trailing white space is
  # ignored

  [TaskGroup2]
  TaskName2
  TaskName3

  \endcode

  Task groups are free-form descriptors used to collect related classes.
  Task group names may only contain alphanumeric characters and must not
  \i {not} contain spaces.  A task name is the name given
  to the task when it is declared in code. It consists of alphanumeric characters and cannot contain
  spaces.  Groups may be nested hierarchically as shown in the example.  Nesting
  one group in another is \i {exactly} the same as pasting the body of the
  nested group into the parent group.  The above \c {Tasks.cfg} file is
  equivalent to:

  \code
  [TaskGroup1]
  TaskName1
  TaskName2
  TaskName3

  [TaskGroup2]
  TaskName2
  TaskName3
  \endcode

\section2 Reserved task Group Names
The following group names are reserved and have a special purpose:
\table
  \header \o Group Name \o Description
\row
    \o prestartup  \o  The \c {prestartup} contains tasks that will be started immediately after Qt Extended is executed.
\row
    \o startup \o The \c {startup} group contains tasks to be launched at startup.
\row
    \o idle \o  The \c {idle} group contains tasks which will be launched after the UI is shown
                while the system is idle.
\row
    \o exclude \o The \c {exclude} group contains tasks that, while present in the
            server, will \c {never} be created.  Adding a task to the \c {exclude}
            group  is equivalent to removing it from the server.
\row
    \o All \o  The \c {All} group is a catch all tasks whose startup preference is not
            otherwise specified.
\endtable

How these groups interact will be covered shortly.


\section2 Supported Task Types

Tasks are constructed in one of two ways: preemptively or on-demand.
\table
\header \o Type \o Description
\row
    \o Preemptive Tasks \o  Preemptive tasks are those started by the system
        during startup, regardless of whether or not any other task has asked for it.
        Some preemptive tasks can have their construction delayed by being placed
        in the \i {idle} group.
\row
    \o On-demand Tasks \o On-demand tasks are those whose creation is deferred
        until another task requests it be started.  Tasks in the \i {startup}
        group in \c {Tasks.cfg} are the only tasks that are created preemptively.
        All other tasks (with the exception of those in the \i {exclude} group
        are started on demand.
\endtable

  While it is possible to instantiate an on-demand task by name, it is generally
  not advisable as doing so often creates unnecessary coupling within the
  system.  Instead, requesters ask the system to return a task that
  supports a given interface.  Doing so allows a particular implementation to
  be switched out without any code changes to the requestor.


  \section2 Marking Preemptive Tasks for Delayed Construction

  By default, preemptive tasks are created before the user interface is displayed.
  This means a task which is expensive to construct delays showing the user
  interface.
  To avoid this, tasks in the \c {Tasks.cfg} file can be marked as suitable for
  delayed construction by placing them in the \i {idle} group.

  Tasks in this group will be started shortly after the UI is displayed
  if the system is idle.  If the user interacts with the system, their construction
  may be further delayed.
  Tasks which provide background services without any user-visible components are
  suitable for this group.


  \section2 Marking Tasks to be Started on Demand

  Tasks in the \c {Tasks.cfg} file can be marked as demand started tasks by appending the
  \c {:demand} to their task name.  Similarly, group names can have \c {:demand}
  appended, which is equivalent to adding the designator to each of their
  containing task or sub-group names.  Demand tasks will never be picked by the
  \c {All} catch all task, but are otherwise subject to all ordering primatives.


  \section2 Tasks Startup Order

  The qtopiaTask() and qtopiaTasks() templates are used to request a task
  interface.  qtopiaTask() returns the first task that implements the interface
  and qtopiaTasks() returns all the tasks that implement the interface.  Each of
  these calls takes an optional boolean parameter to indicate whether the system
  should instantiate a task to satisfy the request (if needed) or only return
  tasks that have previously been instantiated.

  The order of tasks returned by qtopiaTask() and qtopiaTasks() is controllable
  through the order in which they appear in the \c {Tasks.cfg} file.  Consider
  the \c {Tasks.cfg} flattened so that it consists of a list of all groups in the order
  in which they appear.  Each task in this imaginary
  task list implements zero or more interfaces.  The order tasks will be
  returned when requested by interface is the same order as those tasks appear
  in this list, with duplicates removed.

  As a special "catch-all", primarily to prevent incorrect configuration, the special
  \c {All} task can be added to the \c {startup} or \c {idle} group.  This has the effect
  of inserting all tasks not otherwise assigned to a group or explicitly marked as demand
  started tasks.


  While the QtopiaServerApplication class itself is not strictly a task,
  it is instantiated during startup by the task system in the same way as other
  tasks under the special task name \c {QtopiaApplication}.  The
  \c {QtopiaApplication} task should be instantiated immediately after any
  environment setup or cleanup type tasks as many other tasks have an implicit
  reliance on its existence.

  The order that the system will try and start preemptive tasks and the order
  in which tasks will be given interface preference can be read from the value
  space immediately following the \c {QtopiaApplication} task executing.  The
  exact schema is:

  \table
  \header \o Item \o Type \o Description
  \row \o \c {/System/Tasks/<TaskName>/Order/Static} \o int \o The preemptive order that the system determined it would launch tasks.  This may be different from the actual order if one task demand loads another that would otherwise be loaded later.
  \row \o \c {/System/Tasks/<TaskName>/Order/Launch} \o int \o The order that the tasks were actually launched in.  This key will only exist if the task is active.
  \row \o \c {/System/Tasks/<TaskName>/Order/Interface} \o int \o The order that the task will be given when determining interface associations.
  \row \o \c {/System/Tasks/<TaskName>/State} \o String \o  "Disable" if the task was in the \c {exclude} list, "Active" if the task is running, or "Inactive" if not.
  \endtable
  
  A tutorial on how to develop new server tasks can be found in 
  the \l{Integration guide#Server Tasks}{Device Integration guide}.

  \section2 Server task plug-ins
  
  The above server tasks are linked into the Qt Extended server at build time. To increase the flexibility server tasks can be provided via a plug-in mechanism. This allows the addition of new tasks after the deployment of the server binary. Server task plugins must implement the ServerTaskPlugin interface in order to be recognized by the system. 

  For more information on how to develop plug-in based server tasks refer to the \l {Tutorial: Writing server task plugin}{Server task plug-in tutorial}.

  \section1 Qt Extended Server Widgets

  There are many cases of Qt widgets being used throughout the Qt Extended server
  that may need to be customized to achieve a desired look and feel.  For
  example, while it supports customization through theming, a customer that
  wants to replace the Qt Extended phone dialer with a "rotary dial" style dialer
  would need to replace the entire dialer widget.

  To simplify the task and minimize the code changes needed to replace visual
  components of the Qt Extended Server, the concept of Qt Extended Server Widgets exists.
  Qt Extended Server Widgets splits the definition of a visual component - or server
  widget - into two parts: the server widget interface (hereafter referred to as
  the AbstractWidget) and the concrete server widget implementation
  (ConcreteWidget).  While not technically necessary, the AbstractWidget is
  generally an abstract interface that derives directly from QWidget.

  Rather than using the regular \c {new ClassName(parent, flags)} syntax for
  instantiating a widget, the special qtopiaWidget() template method,
  parameterized on AbstractWidget, is provided.  This method uses the server
  widgets replacement system to look up the ConcreteWidget instance type it
  should return.

  Developers use the  QTOPIA_REPLACE_WIDGET(),  QTOPIA_REPLACE_WIDGET_WHEN() and
   QTOPIA_REPLACE_WIDGET_OVERRIDE() macros to provide ConcreteWidget for a
  particular AbstractWidget.  The server widget replacement system then resolves
  which ConcreteWidget to return by executing the following set of rules in
  order until a ConcreteWidget is determined.

  \table
  \header \o Rule \o Description
  \row \o Explicitly specified \o The \c {Trolltech/ServerWidgets} configuration
  file is read to determine if the ConcreteWidget to use has been explicitly
  specified.  The configuration file contains one group, \c {Mapping} that
  contains mappings between \i {AbstractName} and \i {ConcreteName}.  How these
  two names are determined is discussed below.  For example,

  \code
  [Mapping]
  BrowserScreen=Wheel
  DialerScreen=Rotary
  \endcode

  Unless the specified widget does not exist, the mapping is always honored.
  That is, using  QTOPIA_REPLACE_WIDGET_WHEN() can not override explicitly
  specified widgets.  The special name \c None will disable the widget, causing
  qtopiaWidget() to always return null.

  \row \o Primary Default \o The primary default is the value of the
  \c {Mapping/Default} key, or \c Default if not specified. The primary default
  name is tried as the \i {ConcreteName}.  Feature dependencies are honored.
  \row \o Other Defaults \o All \i {ConcreteName}'s beginning with the primary
  default name are tried.  Feature dependencies are honored.
  \row \o All Replacements \o All available ConcreteWidgets are tried.  Feature
  dependencies are honored.
  \endtable

  The \i {AbstractName} and \i {ConcreteName} names used to identify a server
  widget are derived from the widget class names.  \i {AbstractName} is
  set to the AbstractWidget's full name, unless the name begins with
  \c {QAbstract} in which case it is set to the widget class name, minus the
  \c {QAbstract} prefix.  The \i {ConcreteName} is set to the class name of
  the ConcreteWidget, unless the class name ends with the \i {AbstractName} of
  the widget it is replacing, in which case it is set to the widget class name
  minus the \i {AbstractName} suffix.  These rules are designed to simplify
  writing mapping files - a class \c WheelBrowserScreen replacing
  \c QAbstractBrowserScreen is written as \c {BrowserScreen=Wheel} rather than
  \c {QAbstractBrowserScreen=WheelBrowserScreen}.

  The following image also demonstrates the widget selection process:

  \image WidgetSelectionRules.png "Selecting the correct Server Widget"

  \section2 Singleton pattern

    Usually each call to qtopiaWidget() returns a new server widget instance. In some cases this
    behaviour is not desired. If it is necessary to return a reference to an already existing instance
    of a server widget Qt's meta system class info should be used to mark an
    abstract server widget as singleton. This means that every concrete implementation of
    this abstract widget will follow the singleton pattern. The \c SingletonServerWidget string is reserved
    to enable this feature. If the class info tag is missing Qt Extended assumes that the class
    does not follow the singleton pattern.

    For example:
    \code
    //qabstracthomescreen.h
    class QAbstractHomeScreen : public QWidget
    {
       QOBJECT
       Q_CLASSINFO("SingletonServerWidget", "true");
       // ...
    };
    \endcode

    The following code segment demonstrates the difference:

    \code
    QAbstractHomeScreen* ref1 = qtopiaWidget<QAbstractHomeScreen>();
    QAbstractHomeScreen* ref2 = qtopiaWidget<QAbstractHomeScreen>();

    if ( ref1 == ref2 ) {
        ...
        //The SingletonServerWidget class info is set to true for
        //QAbstractHomeScreen (as seen in above example).
    } else {
        ...
        //The SingletonServerWidget class info is set to false
        //or not defined at all.";
    }
    \endcode

    A tutorial on how to develop new server widgets can be found in the QAbstractServerInterface
    class documentation and the \l{integration-guide.html#server-widgets}{Device Integration guide}.

  obviously not provide interfaces.

  \a TaskName should be set to the name of the task, and \a Function to the

  \relates QtopiaServerApplication

  Set \a ConcreteWidget as the \bold {static} replacement for \a AbstractWidget.

  While as efficient as possible, use of the widget replacement system instead
  of explicitly instantiating concrete classes does introduce some indirection
  costs.  For shipping software where this flexibility is not necessary,
  QTOPIA_REPLACE_WIDGET_OVERRIDE() can be used to force the selection of a
  specified \a ConcreteWidget.  This eliminates the cost of the widget
  replacement system for the particular \a AbstractWidget by bypassing the
  replacement system.  The macro should appear inline with the \a AbstractWidget
  declaration, and must have visibility of the \a ConcreteWidget's declaration.


  For example,
  \code

  {
      // ...
  };

  #include "wheelbrowserscreen.h"
  QTOPIA_REPLACE_WIDGET_OVERRIDE(QAbstractBrowserScreen, WheelBrowserScreen);

/*!
  Add an object \a them to \a me to create an "aggregate" task.  Aggregate tasks
  are designed to work around the limitations in Qt's support for multiple
  interface inheritance by allowing multiple objects to be "stuck together" to
  form a single object from the task system's perspective.

  For example, consider the following interfaces:

  \code
  class ApplicationTypeLauncher : public QObject {};
  QTOPIA_TASK_INTERFACE(ApplicationTypeLauncher);
  class SystemShutdownHandler : public QObject {};
  QTOPIA_TASK_INTERFACE(SystemShutdownHandler);
  \endcode

  Using direct inheritance a single task could not implement both interfaces.
  Instead, a task can create one object that implements the
  \c {ApplicationTypeLauncher} interface and one that implements the
  \c {SystemShutdownHandler} interface and aggregate them together.

  \code
  class MyLauncherShutdown : public SystemShutdownHandler
  {
  public:
      MyLauncherShutdown(MyLauncherType *);
  };

  class MyLauncherType : public ApplicationTypeLauncher
  {
  public:
      MyLauncherType()
      {
          MyLauncherShutdown *s = new MyLauncherShutdown(this);
          QtopiaServerApplication::addAggregateObject(this, s);
      }
  };
  QTOPIA_TASK(MyLauncherType, MyLauncherType);
  QTOPIA_TASK_PROVIDES(MyLauncherType, ApplicationTypeLauncher);
  QTOPIA_TASK_PROVIDES(MyLauncherType, SystemShutdownHandler);
  \endcode

  When the system attempts to cast a task to a particular interface, it first
  tries the task object itself, and then each of the aggregate objects for that
  task.

  \brief The SystemShutdownHandler class notifies tasks when the system is shutting down or restarting.

  The SystemShutdownHandler provides a Qt Extended Server Task interface.  Qt Extended Server Tasks are documented in full in the QtopiaServerApplication class
  documentation.

  Server components can use the SystemShutdownHandler to integrate into the
  shutdown mechanism.

  Tasks that provide the SystemShutdownHandler interface are called when the
  system is shutting down or restarting.  By providing this interface, tasks
  can ensure that they clean up appropriately before a shutdown or restart.

  During shutdown or restart, the systemShutdown() or systemRestart() methods
  are invoked respectively.  If a task cannot complete its cleanup synchronously
  in this invocation, it may return false which indicates that it has
  not completed.  Other handlers will continue to be invoked, but the final
  shutdown or restart will not occur until all such incomplete handlers have
  emitted the proceed() signal.

  All shutdown handlers must successfully complete shutdown within
  timeout() milliseconds.

  Shutdown is controlled through the QtopiaServerApplication::shutdown() method.

  This class is part of the Qt Extended server and cannot be used by other Qt Extended applications.

/*!
  \fn void SystemShutdownHandler::proceed()

  Emitted to indicate the completion of this instances portion of shutdown or
  restart.  This signal should only ever be emitted after the class has delayed
  the completion of a shutdown or restart by returning false from the
  systemRestart() or systemShutdown() methods.

/*!
  \fn int SystemShutdownHandler::timeout()

  Returns an upper bound on the amount of time a shutdown handler may take to process
  a shutdown request, in milliseconds.
  If a shutdown handler has not finished in this time, the server may forcibly
  proceed with the shutdown.

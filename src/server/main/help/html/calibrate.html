<p>To ensure that where you tap on the screen matches the screen contents, you may occasionally need to re-calibrate the touch screen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the <b>Recalibrate</b> settings application and follow the on-screen instructions.</li>
<li>The screen will change and show a cross near the top left of the screen.</li>
<li>Press the stylus in the center of the cross, hold for a moment, then release.</li>
<li>The cross will then move to another position.</li>
<li>Press, hold and release once again. Continue until re-calibration has successfully been completed.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> the calibration process will repeat if it detects any inaccuracies.</p>

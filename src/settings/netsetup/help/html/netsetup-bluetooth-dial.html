<p>Complete the form by entering the information into the following fields:</p>
<p>The <b>dial string</b> is required for every connection. 
A typical dial string would be<br><br><b>*99***1#</b><br></p>
<p>The second field can contain <b>additional AT commands</b> which are issued before the dial command is executed.
Usually this is used to select the APN and the transfer protocol. Each command must be on a new line.
<br><br>
A typical APN selection may look like this:
<br><br>
<b>+CGDCONT=1,"IP","internet"</b>
<br><br>
Note: The dial command must not include the AT prefix.

   <h3>Advanced Options</h3>
<!--#endif -->
<p>The following options allow a more detailed configuration of the network service. Usually it should not be required to change these parameters.</p>

<p><b>Auto routing:</b> the network service is added as the default route to the system routing tables</p>
<p><b>External serial device:</b> if this option is ticked you can manually enter a device node to the serial device, e.g. /dev/ttyS1. If this option is un-ticked the service will use the internal modem for a data connection.</p>
<p><b>AT-dial:</b> the AT-dial dial code supplied by your ISP, e.g. ATDT.</p>
<p><b>Speed:</b> at which modem should connect (influenced by ISP).</p>
<p><b>Flow Control</b> data transfer protocol. Recommended.</p>
<p><b>Wait Time</b> acceptable delay for other end of connection to communicate. If data transfer to device is delayed more than this time, then auto disconnect. Use the default 5 seconds, or increase the time if you have problems connecting.</p>
<p><b>Silent dial tone:</b> suppresses the dial tone if selected.</p>

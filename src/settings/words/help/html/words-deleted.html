   <h3>Deleted Words</h3>
<!--#endif-->
<p>Deleted words are those that you want removed from the dictionary,
i.e. the software should never accept/suggest that word.</p>
<p>To delete a word, look it up in the vocabulary, then select <b>Delete</b> from the menu.</p>
<p>When words in the system dictionary are deleted, they are just <b>marked</b> as deleted, so you
can review and edit the list of deleted words if you change your mind. Words you
add yourself disappear once deleted.</p>
